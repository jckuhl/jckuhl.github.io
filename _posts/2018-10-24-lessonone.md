# Lesson 1

What do I write about?
1. Appeal to reader's passions
2. Write about things you care about
3. Chose a time and place that best suits the story
4. Make it unique - don't copy and paste other stories
5. Make it real - keep it consistent.
6. Become invisible - don't put yourself in the novel
7. Know your market - don't write something that won't sell
8. Don't chase the market - write what you care about

Plot vs Story

A **plot** is the stuff that happens.  Plot is physical.  Events go from A to B to C.  It is the character's journey.

A **story** is the way your character feels.  Story is emotional.  It is the character's development.

The plot causes the protagonist to change which drives the story.  The plot is action while the story is reaction.

Story lets us know the character.  Plot moves the character around.  Too much plot bogs down the story.

Books, by their nature, are more story oriented than movies because books allow you to feel exactly as the character feels.  Successful books, such as *Harry Potter*, achieve a good balance between plot and story and show how a character changes over time.
