Well . . . there's a typo in my title.  I spelled "recipe" wrong.  This is usually not a problem, unless you're neck deep in an [Angular tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2) making an app with about a half a dozen components and you realize belatedly, that you spelled "recipe" wrong.

Right now, it's just too much effort to fix.  Thankfully VSCode will auto-fill what I write so I don't have to constantly remind myself that I spelled recipe wrong.

VSCode, by the way, is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  The syntax highlighting is clear and consistent, the auto-fill is extremely useful and jumps from file to file, so long as you've got an import statement.   Plugging in Emmet really helps with filling out HTML components.  The file tree is responsive to the CLI, so if I enter:

    
    ng g c my-component


my new folder with my new component and all it's parts show up for me to use instantly.

It is fast, handy and lightweight.  Using TSLint or JSLint, it helpfully underlines mistakes in your code, even highlighting your file tree to display where exactly the problem is.

I think I've fallen in love.  Download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  I like it better than Sublime.

Today was suppose to be Day 73.  But I might have to start over again.  Work got in the way and I wasn't able to keep to the commitment.
