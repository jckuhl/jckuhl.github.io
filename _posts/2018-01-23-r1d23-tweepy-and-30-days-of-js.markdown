I managed to annoy my Twitter followers today for ten minutes.  I put together a little Python script with Tweepy.  Very basic, after authenticating my information, it updated my status once every minute for ten minutes with a new status.   It was not a very big script, so I didn't bother with Pycharm, I just whipped it up in IDLE.

This was the result:

It was fun while it lasted.  I could have been a bit more clever with the grammar, "this is the 8 post of many" is not good English, at all.

You can get the source code on a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jckuhl/6da5610619524baa10d3c3dfee8f205e) over at Github.  Obviously I've taken out the API keys Twitter provided for me to use.  I got most of the code by following John Fischer's [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoMAKPDECRWb7GEWF1lQZMQ).

Here's how it appeared on my end:

In other news, I found a fun site to practice JavaScript.  The [Thirty Day Code Challenge](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5a66485ca6b56c55273b5479/view/194130581) gives you thirty days worth of 30 minute coding projects to learn JavaScript with.  I had trouble getting the videos to load in Chrome, but they work fine in Firefox.  I started off making a drum kit and learned how adding data attributes to HTML tags can add some flexibility to your code.  It's worth checking out.
